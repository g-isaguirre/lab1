## What I Hope to Learn in INFO 201 

I hope to gain skills that will help me pursue an **Informatics degree** and for my future career! :^) 

#### things that I am *excited* about:
* learning how to program in R!
* collaborating with other people!
* creating a final project!

#### things that I am *nervous* about: 
* the course being online and in a platform I'm not used to
* feeling less connected to resources
* teammates not being the most accessible during this circumstance
